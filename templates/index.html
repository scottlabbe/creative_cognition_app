      This assessment is designed to evaluate the ways in which you prefer to be creative, 
      <strong><em><u>or your individual creative cognitive style.</u></em></strong>
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      This includes a questionnaire to understand your individual preferences for learning and 
      applying knowledge, as well as open-ended exercises intended to understand your ability 
      to generate original ideas, solve problems creatively, and think flexibly.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      The results will offer insight into your individual creativity, to hopefully empower 
      you to tailor your approach to creative tasks, collaborate more effectively with others, 
      and ultimately, feel more comfortable applying creativity in your work or everyday life.
