          "intuitives": "While this may be the most comfortable and likely quite fun, diversifying your thought partnership with other types of Creative people will help you all realize and implement the ideas you freely generate. If only with other intuitives, deadlines, visual aids and tangible frameworks will be required to make progress.",
          "conceptuals": "While both styles prioritize ideas, Intuitives might find Conceptual Creatives too focused on logic and structure. To collaborate effectively, Intuitives should be prepared to explain the \"why\" behind their ideas and engage in open-ended discussions exploring the theoretical underpinnings and implications of their ideas.",
          "pragmatists": "While they may be on \"opposites\" , these styles can complement each other well. Pragmatics can help refine and implement ideas, while Intuitives can bring fresh perspectives and to inspire divergent thinking. Intuitives should be prepared to share ideas in a structured, organized and visual way demonstrating the practical applications of their concepts.",
          "deductives": "This pairing can be dynamic and energetic if handled correctly. The focus on action and moving forward from Actives, compliment to the big thinking of Intuitives. However, Intuitives may need to be patient with Active Creatives' desire for immediate action."

        "weaknesses": [
          "While thinking big and generating ideas comes naturally, applying those ideas within rigid structures requiring detailed thinking might be more difficult. \n\nMay struggle with explaining the reasoning behind their ideas.\nCan become overwhelmed by too much structure or detail.\nMay overlook practical considerations or potential risks."

To collaborate effectively, Conceptual Creatives should prepare themselves to be open to exploring unconventional approaches, suspending some of that logical thinking that usually leads them to the right answer eventually.",

Designing in moments to seek out challenge and feedback can be helpful to not get stuck in theory and abstract models, while encouraging thinking about practicality.",

Conceptual Creatives can provide the vision and framework, while Pragmatic Creatives can refine and implement the ideas in a practical way. However, this pairing could benefit from scheduling brainstorming sessions where both parties are encouraged to explore unconventional ideas without judgment, injecting a dose of ambiguity and \"white space\" thinking into the process.",

          "While they excel at deep thinking, they can sometimes get lost in the abyss. A gentle reminder to come up for air, embrace the present moment and seek additional perspectives might be needed now and then. Can overthink or overanalyze, leading to \"analysis paralysis.\" May become attached to their ideas and resistant to change. Might struggle with ambiguity and spontaneity."
